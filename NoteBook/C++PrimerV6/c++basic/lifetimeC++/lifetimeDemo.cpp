// Lifetime
// Every object and reference has a lifetime, which is a runtime property: for any object or reference, 
// there is a point of execution of a program when its lifetime begins, and there is a moment when it ends.

// The lifetime of an object begins when:
// 1. storage with the proper alignment and size for its type is obtained
// 2. its initialization (if any) is complete (including default initialization via no constructor or trivial default constructor)
